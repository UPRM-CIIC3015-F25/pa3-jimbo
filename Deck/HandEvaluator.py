# TODO (TASK 3): Implement a function that evaluates a player's poker hand.
#   Loop through all cards in the given 'hand' list and collect their ranks and suits.
#   Use a dictionary to count how many times each rank appears to detect pairs, three of a kind, or four of a kind.
#   Sort these counts from largest to smallest. Use another dictionary to count how many times each suit appears to check
#   for a flush (5 or more cards of the same suit). Remove duplicate ranks and sort them to detect a
#   straight (5 cards in a row). Remember that the Ace (rank 14) can also count as 1 when checking for a straight.
#   If both a straight and a flush occur in the same suit, return "Straight Flush". Otherwise, use the rank counts
#   and flags to determine if the hand is: "Four of a Kind", "Full House", "Flush", "Straight", "Three of a Kind",
#   "Two Pair", "One Pair", or "High Card". Return a string with the correct hand type at the end.
